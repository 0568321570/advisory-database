## GitHub Advisory Database 

A database of CVEs and GitHub-originated security advisories affecting the open source world. 

The database is free and open source and is a tool for and by the community.

Submit pull requests to help improve our database of software vulnerability information for all. 

## Features 

All advisories acknowledged by GitHub are stored as individual files in this repository. They are formatted in the [Open Source Vulnerability (OSV) format](https://ossf.github.io/osv-schema/). 

You can submit a pull request to this advisory (see, [`Contributions`](#contributions)) to change or update the information in each advisory. 

Pull requests will be reviewed and either merged or closed by our internal security advisory curation team. If the advisory originated from a GitHub repository, we will also tag the original publisher for optional commentary.

## Goals

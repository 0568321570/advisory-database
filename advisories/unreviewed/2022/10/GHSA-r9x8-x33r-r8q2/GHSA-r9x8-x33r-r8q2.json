The device embedded browser does not prevent interaction with alternative URI schemes when redirected to corresponding resources by web application code. By setting the homepage URI, the favorite URIs, or redirecting embedded browser users via JavaScript code to alternative scheme resources, a remote low privileged attacker can perform a range of attacks against the device, such as read arbitrary files on the filesystem, execute arbitrary JavaScript code in order to steal or manipulate the information on the screen, or trigger denial of service conditions.",

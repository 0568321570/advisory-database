  "details": "A write-what-where condition in hermes caused by an integer overflow, prior to commit 5b6255ae049fa4641791e47fad994e8e8c4da374 allows attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code via crafted JavaScript. Note that this is only exploitable if the application using Hermes permits evaluation of untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.",

  ],
  "details": "The parsing mechanism that processes certain file types does not provide input sanitization for file paths. This may allow an attacker to craft malicious files that, when opened by Rockwell Automation Connected Components Workbench v12.00.00 and prior, can traverse the file system. If successfully exploited, an attacker could overwrite existing files and create additional files with the same permissions of the Connected Components Workbench software. User interaction is required for this exploit to be successful.",

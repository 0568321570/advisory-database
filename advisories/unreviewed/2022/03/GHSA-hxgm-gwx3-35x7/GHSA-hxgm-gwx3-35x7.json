  "details": "A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.29). When returning the result of a completed Microflow execution call the affected framework does not correctly verify, if the request was initially made by the user requesting the result. Together with predictable identifiers for Microflow execution calls, this could allow a malicious attacker to retrieve information about arbitrary Microflow execution calls made by users within the affected system.",

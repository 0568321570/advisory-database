Craft CMS uses a cookie called CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN and a HTML hidden field called CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN to avoid Cross Site Request Forgery attacks. The CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN cookie discloses the password hash in without encoding it whereas the corresponding HTML hidden field discloses the users' password hash in a masked manner, which can be decoded by using public functions of the YII framework.",

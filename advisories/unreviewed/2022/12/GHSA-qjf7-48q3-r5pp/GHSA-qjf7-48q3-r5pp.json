  ],
  "details": "An issue was discovered in the endpoint protection agent in Zoho ManageEngine Device Control Plus 10.1.2228.15. Despite configuring complete restrictions on USB pendrives, USB HDD devices, memory cards, USB connections to mobile devices, etc., it is still possible to bypass the USB restrictions by booting into Safe Mode. This allows a file to be exchanged outside the laptop/system. Safe Mode can be launched by any user (even without admin rights). Data exfiltration can occur, and also malware might be introduced onto the system.",

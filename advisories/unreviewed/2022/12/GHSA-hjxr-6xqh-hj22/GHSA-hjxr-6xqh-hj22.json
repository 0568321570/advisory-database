  "details": "The Permalink Manager Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including 2.2.20.3 due to improper output escaping on post/page/media titles. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts on the permalink-manager page if another plugin or theme is installed on the site that allows lower privileged users with unfiltered_html the ability to modify post/page titles with malicious web scripts.",

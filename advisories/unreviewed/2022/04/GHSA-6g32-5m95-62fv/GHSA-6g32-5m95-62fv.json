  "details": "An issue was discovered in YottaDB through r1.32 and V7.0-000 and FIS GT.M through V7.0-000. Using crafted input, an attacker can cause a call to $Extract to force an signed integer holding the size of a buffer to take on a large negative number, which is then used as the length of a memcpy call that occurs on the stack, causing a buffer overflow.",

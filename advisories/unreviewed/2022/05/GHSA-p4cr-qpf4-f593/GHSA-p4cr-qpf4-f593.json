  "details": "The DNS feature in InterNiche NicheStack TCP/IP 4.0.1 is affected by: Buffer Overflow. The impact is: execute arbitrary code (remote). The component is: DNS response processing functions: dns_upcall(), getoffset(), dnc_set_answer(). The attack vector is: a specific DNS response packet. The code does not check the \"response data length\" field of individual DNS answers, which may cause out-of-bounds read/write operations, leading to Information leak, Denial-or-Service, or Remote Code Execution, depending on the context.",

  "details": "Aerospike Community Edition 4.9.0.5 allows for unauthenticated submission and execution of user-defined functions (UDFs), written in Lua, as part of a database query. It attempts to restrict code execution by disabling os.execute() calls, but this is insufficient. Anyone with network access can use a crafted UDF to execute arbitrary OS commands on all nodes of the cluster at the permission level of the user running the Aerospike service.",

  "details": "In FreeBSD 11.3-STABLE before r350217, 11.3-RELEASE before 11.3-RELEASE-p1, and 11.2-RELEASE before 11.2-RELEASE-p12, due to insufficient initialization of memory copied to userland in the freebsd32_ioctl interface, small amounts of kernel memory may be disclosed to userland processes. This may allow an attacker to leverage this information to obtain elevated privileges either directly or indirectly.",

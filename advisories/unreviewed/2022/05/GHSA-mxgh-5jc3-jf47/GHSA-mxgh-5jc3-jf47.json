  "details": "FastTrack Admin By Request 6.1.0.0 supports group policies that are supposed to allow only a select range of users to elevate to Administrator privilege at will. If a user does not have direct access to the elevation feature through group policies, they are prompted to enter a PIN code in a challenge-response manner upon attempting to elevate privileges. The challenge's response uses a simple algorithm that can be easily emulated via data (customer ID and device name) available to all users, and thus any user can elevate to Administrator privilege.",

  "details": "In the KeepKey firmware before 7.3.2, the bootloader can be exploited in unusual situations in which the attacker has physical access, convinces the victim to install malicious firmware, or knows the victim's seed phrase. lib/board/supervise.c mishandles svhandler_flash_* address range checks. If exploited, any installed malware could persist even after wiping the device and resetting the firmware.",

  "details": "BKG Professional NtripCaster 2.0.39 allows querying information over the UDP protocol without authentication. The NTRIP sourcetable is typically quite long (tens of kBs) and can be requested with a packet of only 30 bytes. This presents a vector that can be used for UDP amplification attacks. Normally, only authenticated streaming data will be provided over UDP and not the sourcetable.",

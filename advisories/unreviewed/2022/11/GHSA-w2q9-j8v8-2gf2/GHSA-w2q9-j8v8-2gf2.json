  "details": "The target's backtrace indicates that libc has detected a heap error or that the target was executing a heap function when it stopped. This could be due to heap corruption, passing a bad pointer to a heap function such as free(), etc. Since heap errors might include buffer overflows, use-after-free situations, etc. they are generally considered exploitable.",

  "details": "** DISPUTED ** A stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in Text Editors and Formats in Backdrop CMS before 1.24.2 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the name parameter. When a user is editing any content type (e.g., page, post, or card) as an admin, the stored XSS payload is executed upon selecting a malicious text formatting option. NOTE: the vendor disputes the security relevance of this finding because \"any administrator that can configure a text format could easily allow Full HTML anywhere.\"",

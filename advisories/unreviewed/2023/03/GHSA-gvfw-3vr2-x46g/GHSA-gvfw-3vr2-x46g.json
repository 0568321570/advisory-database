  "details": "A flaw was found in X.Org Server Overlay Window. A Use-After-Free may lead to local privilege escalation. If a client explicitly destroys the compositor overlay window (aka COW), the Xserver would leave a dangling pointer to that window in the CompScreen structure, which will trigger a use-after-free later.",

  "details": "GNU Emacs through 28.2 allows attackers to execute commands via shell metacharacters in the name of a source-code file, because lib-src/etags.c uses the system C library function in its implementation of the etags program. For example, a victim may use the \"etags -u *\" command (suggested in the etags documentation) in a situation where the current working directory has contents that depend on untrusted input.",

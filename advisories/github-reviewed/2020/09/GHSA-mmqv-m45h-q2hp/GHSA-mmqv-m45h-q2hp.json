  "summary": "Sandbox Breakout / Arbitrary Code Execution in localeval",
  "details": "All versions of `localeval` are vulnerable to Sandbox Escape leading to Remote Code Execution. The package fails to restrict access to the main context through `constructor.constructor`. This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system.  Evaluating the payload \n```\nconstructor.constructor(\"return process.env\")()\n``` \n\nreturns the contents of `process.env`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",

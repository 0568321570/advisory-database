  "summary": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data in rpc.py",
  "details": "rpc.py through 0.6.0 allows Remote Code Execution because an unpickle occurs when the \"serializer: pickle\" HTTP header is sent. In other words, although JSON (not Pickle) is the default data format, an unauthenticated client can cause the data to be processed with unpickle.\n\n[Per the maintainer](https://github.com/abersheeran/rpc.py/issues/22), rpc.py is not designed for an API that is open to the outside world, and external requests cannot reach rpc.py in real world use.\n\nA [fix](https://github.com/abersheeran/rpc.py/commit/491e7a841ed9a754796d6ab047a9fb16e23bf8bd) exists on the `master` branch. As a workaround, use the following code to turn off pickle in older versions:\n```\ndel SERIALIZER_NAMES[PickleSerializer.name]\ndel SERIALIZER_TYPES[PickleSerializer.content_type]",

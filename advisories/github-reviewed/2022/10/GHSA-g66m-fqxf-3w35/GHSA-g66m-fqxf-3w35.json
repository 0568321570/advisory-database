  "summary": "Jenkins Pipeline: Input Step Plugin vulnerable to Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context",
  "details": "Jenkins Pipeline: Input Step Plugin 451.vf1a_a_4f405289 and earlier does not restrict or sanitize the optionally specified ID of the `input` step, which is used for the URLs that process user interactions for the given `input` step (proceed or abort) and is not correctly encoded, allowing attackers able to configure Pipelines to have Jenkins build URLs from `input` step IDs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any target URL in Jenkins when the 'input' step is interacted with. Pipeline: Input Step Plugin 456.vd8a_957db_5b_e9 limits the characters that can be used for the ID of input steps in Pipelines to alphanumeric characters and URL-safe punctuation. Pipelines with input steps having IDs with prohibited characters will fail with an error.",

  "summary": "Unauthorized view fragment access in Jenkins",
  "details": "Jenkins uses the Stapler web framework to render its UI views. These views are frequently composed of several view fragments, enabling plugins to extend existing views with more content. Jenkins 2.335 through 2.355 (both inclusive) allows attackers in some cases to bypass a protection mechanism, thereby directly accessing some view fragments containing sensitive information, bypassing any permission checks in the corresponding view.",

  "details": "Affected versions of this crate did not implement `Drop` when `#[zeroize(drop)]` was used on an `enum`.\n\nThis can result in memory not being zeroed out after dropping it, which is exactly what is intended when adding this attribute.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in version 1.2 and `#[zeroize(drop)]` on `enum`s now properly implements `Drop`.\n",

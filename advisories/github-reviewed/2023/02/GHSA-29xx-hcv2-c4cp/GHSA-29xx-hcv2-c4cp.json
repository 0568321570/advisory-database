  "summary": "openssl-src subject to Invalid pointer dereference in `d2i_PKCS7` functions",
  "details": "An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with the `d2i_PKCS7()`, `d2i_PKCS7_bio()` or `d2i_PKCS7_fp()` functions.\n\nThe result of the dereference is an application crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function however third party applications might call these functions on untrusted data.\n",
